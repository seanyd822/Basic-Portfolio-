			I have always had a knack for working with compters. I love making mistakes and trying ot fix them so naturally I gravitated to Web Development. My dream is to move to Florida and work for Disney or Universal. I like to play a wide variety of video games in my spare time such as Destiny, Mario, minecraft and NBA 2k18. I also like to just relax and watch a movie or go out and have a few drinks with my friends. Originally from Howell New Jersey, I moved to New Brunswick in May 2017 with my girlfirend Katie. Growing up as a kid i read the Harry Potter series and went to see every movie. It has been a huge part of my life and I even have a tattoo on my right arm spelling out "ALWAYS" in different symbols from the series.
